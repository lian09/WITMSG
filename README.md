# WITMSG
#This is a framework for predicting m6A methylation sites called WITMSG(the whole-introns-transcriptome m6A methylation sites prediction by combining sequence features with genomic features).
#There are five documents in WITMSG, including three R language programs, one intronic m6A methylation sites prediction results and one exonic m6A methylation sites prediction results. Among them, cross.validation.R is the code for ten-fold cross-validation, independent. consistent.R is the code for independent testing when the training set is consistent with the type of the test dataset. Independent.dif.R is the code for independent testing when the training set is inconsistent with the type of the test set. Intron.predictor.zip is the prediction results of m6A methylation sites in all introns, exon. predictor. zip is the prediction results of m6A methylation sites in all exons, where they include 7 columns, namely sequence number, chromosome name, locus start and end position, width, strand and the predicted label.
